- 👋 Hi, I’m @intelijah
- 👀 I’m interested in getting better at coding so it can be possible for me to get a job in programming someday, since I don't have money for college. I'd like to work in game creation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement C++ into real programs. It's the only language I know. I'd like to learn as much as I need to know, however.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that interest me like games and code that involves OOP and semi-complex math problems that will make me more flexible with coding.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email is purpleguy5897@gmail.com.
